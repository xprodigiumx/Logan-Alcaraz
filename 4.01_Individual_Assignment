Summary:

In this assignment we are looking over ethical quandrays and how they affect different systems. In this example we are looking at ethical quandrays such as someone selling
personal information, releasing top secret information, and the use of fake social media within different sociotechnological systems. The sociotechnological systems that I
chose for the assignment were Twitter, Facebook, LinkIn, Snapchat, Discord, and iMessage. These are some of the most popular sociotechnological systems that are available,
being used by people of all ages. 

For the first Ethical Quandray, selling personal information, we can see that through many different sources, the marked sources above have not only been breached and had
information stolen, but have been proven to sell personal information to outside personnel. The second Ethical Quandry, Releasing Top Secret Info, crossed many ethical
boundaries as they released information about our National Security, which could lead to vulnerability within our country. Finally, Fake Social Media Accounts, has been
picking up popularity over the last few years and has become a problem that many systems are trying to fix. This example can cause outrest as people will not know what
to believe and begin to lose trust with what they read/see. These Ethical Quandrays are a good example of how sociotechnological systems today still have flaws that need
to be fixed.
